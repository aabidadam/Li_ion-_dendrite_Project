Dendrite Growth Prediction and Pattern Recognition Model
This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built in Python using TensorFlow and Keras. It predicts the growth regions and recognizes patterns in lithium-ion battery dendrites based on input images. The model uses image data to learn features related to dendrite formation and predict future growth patterns.

Project Overview
This project focuses on:

Loading and processing images of lithium-ion dendrites.
Training a CNN model to classify and predict dendrite growth patterns.
Evaluating the modelâ€™s performance and visualizing the results.
Using the trained model to make predictions on new dendrite images.
The project can be adapted to work with various types of dendrite images and adjusted for different patterns of growth.

Requirements
Python 3.7+
TensorFlow 2.0+
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
scikit-learn
You can install the required libraries by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: requirements.txt should contain:

shell
Copy code
tensorflow>=2.0
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dendrite-growth-prediction.git
Navigate to the project folder:
bash
Copy code
cd dendrite-growth-prediction
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Place your image dataset in a folder structure like:
markdown
Copy code
dendrite-images/
  class1/
    image1.jpg
    image2.jpg
    ...
  class2/
    image1.jpg
    image2.jpg
    ...
Usage
Training the Model
To train the model with your own dataset:

Edit the path to your image folder in the main.py script:
python
Copy code
image_folder_path = 'path_to_your_dendrite_images'
Run the training script:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
The model will load the image data, preprocess it, and start training. The training progress will be displayed, and the model will be saved as dendrite_growth_prediction_model.h5 upon completion.

Making Predictions
Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict dendrite growth on new images:

Load the trained model in your script:
python
Copy code
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
model = load_model('dendrite_growth_prediction_model.h5')
Preprocess your new images and make predictions:
python
Copy code
new_image = load_and_preprocess('path_to_new_image.jpg')
prediction = model.predict(new_image)
Model Training
The CNN model has three convolutional layers, each followed by a pooling layer, and two dense layers for prediction.
The model uses categorical_crossentropy as the loss function and adam as the optimizer.
You can modify the architecture or training settings in the main.py file as per your requirements.
Visualization
During training, the accuracy and validation accuracy of the model will be plotted using matplotlib. After training, you can run:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
It will generate accuracy and validation accuracy plots to visualize the model's performance.
